# Simulation-of-Spent-Nuclear-Fuel-storage

Four Niryo robots navigates the rod across three walls and places the rod in a receptacle. For the simulation purpose, we assume navigating the wall means transfer of rod from one processing room to another. In addition, Gantry system moves the rod from a receptacle to a concrete cask while navigating through a wall. Due to the radioactive environment, we employ a line following autonomous bot which transfers the concrete cask to a storage unit. Due to the growing interest in dry storage technology, we simulate the transfer of spent nuclear rod to a concrete cask using Coppiliasim simulation software
